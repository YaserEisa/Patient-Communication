# Process:
Team members came up with product vision and stories. Stories were placed into the Pivotal backlog. We then met in a planning meeting to go over the entire backlog, prioritize scenarios and stories (including an epic), and did a consensus estimate for story points. Focus was to get basic functionality - have patients login, view the most important information, and get some communication.
